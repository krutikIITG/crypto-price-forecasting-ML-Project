# BTC-Price-Prediction-ML-Project

## About
This project focuses on the prediction of the prices of Bitcoin, the most in-demand cryptocurrency of today's world. We predict the prices accurately by gathering data available at **[Binance](https://data.binance.com/)** while taking various hyper-parameters into consideration which have affected the Bitcoin prices until now. This comprehensive project implements **13 different machine learning models** ranging from traditional statistical approaches to advanced deep learning techniques.

## Paper presentation
The [paper](9.pdf) contains all details of algorithms used along with results, analysis and discussions on the topic.

### Dataset
* Dataset has been downloaded using the **Binance API** with 365-day historical data.
* Real-time data fetching with OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) features.
